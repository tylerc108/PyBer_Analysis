# PyBer_Analysis
## Analysis Overview
### Explain the purpose of the new analysis.
During our initial analysis, we looked at the data in a variety of ways to try and gain a greater understanding of how customers of the ride-sharing app use the app's services. This new analysis was no different, but here we focused on trying to find trends in the data based on city type, time of year, and total fares accrued by drivers per week. We did this by creating a new data frame with these parameters, developing a pivot table out of the new data frame, and charting this data on a line graph. Overall, this process will help us gain a greater understanding of user behavior and help the company increase profits in the long run.

## Analysis Results
### Using images from the summary DataFrame and multiple-line chart, describe the differences in ride-sharing data among the different city types.
At the end of our analysis, we had created a pivot table with the data frame we developed with the parameters we were analysisng as well as a line graph created using this pivot table. Below is a screenshot of the pivot table:

As you can see, this pivot table breaks down the total fares accrued into three categories, based on city type, and organizes them based off of the week the rides took place. Before going into differences in fare data per city type, let's look at the graphed version of this table to better understand the trends:

As you can see in the above graph, there are very clear differences between the fare data for each city type. The fares for 'urban' cities are the highest of the three at any given point in time, the 'suburban' city fares are the second highest of the three at any given point in time, and the 'rural' fares are the lowest of the three at any given point in time. We can also see that, generally, there is very little variation in the fare data for any of the city types throughout the given time period; we know this because the lines are relatively flat on the graph. This means that fares collected by the company were around the same amount throughout the time period we analysed, so time of year/date as a variable has little effect on the fares collected.

## Summary
### Based on the results, provide three business recommendations to the CEO for addressing any disparities among the city types.
Based off of our analysis, we can recommend the following three recommendations for this business:
* 1. The 'urban' category is very clearly the highest earning city type, so we recommend keeping ride fares relatively stable/low for users in these city types. We know that we are collecting relatively high amount of fares for rides in urban cities, so keeping prices consistent and affordable will keep up the income we are getting from urban riders.
* 2. The 'suburban' category is lower in fare amount than the urban category. We could afford to raise prices for rides slightly in suburban cities so that we can try and increase the total fares we are getting from this city type and try and decrease disparity between suburban and urban city fares.
* 3. The 'rural' category is lowest in fare amount overall, so we recommend raising prices for cities that fall into these categories so that we can try to raise total fares brought in to the company and limit the disparity between the fare total of other city types.
